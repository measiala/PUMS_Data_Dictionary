# PUMS_Data_Dictionary_v2

This is an update to the previous project PUMS_Data_Dictionary. It
greatly improves both the object-oriented approach and couples it with
more robust testing using py.test. This will be the finished version
to hand off to others.

To-Do List

[ ] Complete the handling of record types and the machine readable file.

[ ] Complete final write out of files including testing.
